# CHESSGAME

In a typical chess game, a player can only move their pieces according to certain rules. For example, a pawn can only move forward one or two squares on its first move, while a knight moves in an L-shaped pattern. To help the player understand which moves are legal at any given moment, the chess game can highlight the squares on the board that the player's piece can move to.

To implement this feature, My code first need to determine which piece the player is trying to move, and then calculate which squares that piece can legally move to. I use a set of rules or algorithms to determine the valid moves.

Once I have determined the valid moves, My code can then highlight the corresponding squares on the game board, using some kind of visual cue such as changing the color or brightness of the square. This will help the player quickly understand their options and make their next move more efficiently.

Overall, this feature is designed to make the chess game more user-friendly and accessible, especially for newer players who may not be familiar with all the rules and strategies of the game.
